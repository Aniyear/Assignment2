# AI Model Marketplace

AI Model Marketplace is a decentralized platform where users can list, purchase, and rate AI models. The project is built on the Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts, and it allows creators to sell their AI models, while buyers can purchase and rate them.

## Features
- **List AI Models**: Creators can list their AI models with details like name, description, and price.
- **Purchase AI Models**: Buyers can purchase listed AI models using Ether.
- **Rate AI Models**: Buyers can rate models after purchase, and the rating is reflected in the marketplace.
  
## Technologies Used
- **Solidity**: For writing smart contracts.
- **Web3.js**: For interacting with Ethereum smart contracts from the frontend.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design and UI components.

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) extension installed in your browser.
- Sepolia test network configured in MetaMask.
- Ethereum test Ether in your MetaMask wallet.
